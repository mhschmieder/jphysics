 * An enumeration of the most relevant angle units for angular distance.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: The labels account for the standard of leaving a space between the
 *  numeric value and its associated unit. The utility for making a Combo Box
 *  from an enum trims the space; other contexts need the space for separation.
 * NOTE: The radians field is included because sometimes it is helpful to use
 *  switch statements for degrees vs. radians in computational code bases,
 *  especially when translated from other languages.
 * NOTE: Degrees as minutes, seconds, etc., are not included here, as the main
 *  application for such formats is in the geo space, which is in another API.
