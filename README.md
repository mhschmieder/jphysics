# jphysics

The jphysics library is a Toolkit for concepts usually assigned to physics even when fairly commonly used (such as physical units).

This is split off from my jcommons as the number of files in the physics subpackage was getting quite large once I added the acoustics library to the mix.

Contrarily, this library may shrink a bit once the Units of Measurement JSR finally reaches maturity stage.

Although not everyone has use of acoustics concepts, so many areas of physics do touch upon acoustics that I am leaving it here for now, but it too may become its own library at some point. Currently, it includes pure science as well as concepts from acoustical engineering and related disciplines.

I am aware that there are dozens of Java-based (and weirdly even non-Java based) libraries called JPhysics, with varioous forms of capitalization, but I want my library names to be shorter than they were when I first made them. At that time, I thought they had to be globally unique, so I came up with an overly verbose naming scheme.
